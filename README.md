# os-c9
Repository for OpenShift to use Cloud9

Okay, this likely will not work because Cloud9 need tmux for the terminals, which need ncurses.

Neither tmux nor ncurses is installed on OpenShift pods, and ncurses fails to compile.

I tried everything I know, and at this point I accept defeat.

If someone can help, please do.
